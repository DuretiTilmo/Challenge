# Challenge
##Challenge 1 on HTML and CSS
For this mini project a starter code was provided. The challenge is to improve the existing code without changing what it does by fulfilling the listed requirements. It is a good practice to ensure that with each commit, we make the code better and cleaner than it was before i.e by implementing the Scout rule.

##General Information
The starter code that was given was by it's self functional. All it needed was a little bit of descriptive elements on the images, some semantic HTML elements so that the HTML file is more readable and accessible. Comments are added to the CSS file according to their divisional structure.
